Wouldn't it be great if you could just use your back end to validate forms on the front end? This package provides a `BaseProxy` class that does exactly that. It can post itself to a configured endpoint and manage errors. The class is meant to be used with a Laravel back end.

Take a look at the [usage section](#usage) to view a detailed example on how to use it.

The code of this package is based on the [Object-Oriented Forms lesson](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step/episodes/19) in the [Vue 2.0 series](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step/) on [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/).

## Install

You can install the package via yarn (or npm):

```bash
yarn add laravel-vue-form-validator
```
